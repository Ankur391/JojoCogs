A repo for some of the cogs I have built for Red - Discord bot

## Help
For help you can either join the [support](https://discord.gg/JmCFyq7) server and hop in `#support-jojocogs` or ping me on Red (perferably in testing)
If you have a bug you found you can either ping me in the above servers or make an issue.

## Forking
Forks are great! üç¥
If you would like to contribute, make personal edits, or just about anything just fork this repo (just don't blame me for the bad code)

## Cogs
Here are some of the cogs I've written. Anything marked `X` in the approved section has been approved by me to be pretty much working as intended
Anything marked with `O`, however, is either not working or hasn't been finished
