# Jojo cogs

##### Some of the cogs I have built for red
> * Brownies
>     This Cog allows you to collect brownie points.
>     It was originally devoloped by JJW of [CollectorDevTeam](http://github.com/CollectorDevTeam/)
> * Collectables
>     This Cog allows you to buy Collectables and display them
>     It was originally thought up by [Kreusada](https://github.com/Kreusada) and was first developed by Otriux.
> * Mjolnir
>     This Cog was based on another mini game (My cogs are built around mini games, okay?!) that was in a server I joined and I created it as a cog
>     It allows you to try to lift Thor's hammer. If you succeed the feat you will be added to a global leaderboard
> * Mod Mail
>     This Cog will send any non-command dms your bot receives to a channel of your choosing.
>     Pretty handy for seeing what your users are sending to the bot
> * Pets
>     Basically... I ripped this off of Red's documentation of the config module.
>     You can buy pets and... that's it for now
> * Jojo Store
>     This Cog is a store I made early on working with the Bank and Config modules
>     It acts as a small mini game and also a way to set buyable roles (which is my favorite part of the cog)
> * ToDo
>     Helps you remember stuff by writing a ToDo reminder
>     Still a W.I.P so be careful
