# How to play

1. No swearing (simple it would seem but not really)
2. If and when you do swear you are eliminated. But you'll get eliminated anyway
3. Whoever swore the least wins! (if you're playing on a timed game, that is. Otherwise it'd be the last person remaining)
4. Prizes are up to you!

Have fun!
