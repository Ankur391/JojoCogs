### Basic usage of the Store

1. Creating items that a person can buy.
2. Use a cog that alters a person's bank value
    - eg. the Economy cog
3. Have fun!

### Basic usage of the role buying system
1. Create a role that you would like to add to the store
    - Note this can't be higher or equal to the bot's highest role
2. Again, a bank-altering cog would be the best here as these roles require some credits
3. Have fun!
