### Basic usage of the Store

1. Creating items that a person can buy.
2. Use a cog that alters a person's bank value
    - eg. the Economy cog
3. Have fun!

### Basic usage of the role buying system
1. Create a role that you would like to add to the store
    - Note this can't be higher or equal to the bot's highest role
2. Again, a bank-altering cog would be the best here as these roles require some credits
3. Have fun!

### Command usage
- Roles
  1. Use `[p]role add <role> [cost]` to add a role *note, the price of the role will default to 3000
  2. For listing the roles, use `[p]role list`
  3. For buying the roles, use `[p]role buy <role>` *note, the role has to be exactly the same as the discord role name
- Store
  1. Use `[p]store list` to see the available roles
  2. Use `[p]store buy <item>` to buy an item
  3. To use an item, use `[p]use <item>`
  4. Adding an item to the store is a simple as running `[p]store add <item> [cost]` *note, if no cost is given it will default to 250

###### And that's how you use my store. Have fun!
