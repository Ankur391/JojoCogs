The main purpose of this cog is to completely do away with the "normal" and "boring" economy system that have plauged Discord bots for, frankly, far too long.

This cog's base system will be tying a job type to a user and giving them currency every hour (done probably in a task loop)


For skill points I can either use a level up and a skill tree system probably locked at like 15 points that you can get and spread around to get the most out of your jobs
or I can go with an experience one in which different jobs train a certain skill point
