## Collectables
Set Collectables to buy for credits with Red's Economy.
If you do not have economy (or another cog that works with the Bank cog) you can load it using `[p]load economy`

### Setting Collectables
Use `[p]collectable create <name> [price]`
If price is ommited it will default to 100.

### Obtaining Collectables
Use `[p]collectable buy <collectable>` to purchase a Collectable. You will need to have the proper amount in your bank to buy one.
Alternatively, an admin could use `[p]collectable add <user> <name>` to add a Collectable to your account.

### Seeing the Collectables
Use `[p]collectable list` to see a guild's Collectables
Use `[p]collectables [user]` to see either yours or another member's Collectables
